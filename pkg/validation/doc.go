/*
Package validation provides tag-based validation for structs and values.

Use this package when you need to enforce constraints on application data,
such as required fields, ranges, or format checks, without writing repetitive
validation logic.

Validation rules are defined with "validate" struct tags, and errors identify
the fields that fail validation along with the reason.
